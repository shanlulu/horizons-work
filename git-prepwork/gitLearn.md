Imagine doing this for all your `.js` files. Now imagine collaborating with your team members, at the same time having the need to keep track of which were the files you sent them. What if we have a better solution? Introducing Git - a version control system for source codes. On top of that, Git allows a team of people to work together on the same project files. There are many hosted version control systems out there such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc. At Horizons, we will be using GitHub.
