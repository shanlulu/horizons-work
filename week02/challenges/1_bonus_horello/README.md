# Horello bonus exercises

Congrats on finishing the Horello exercises! You should now have a
Horello web application that looks pretty, that lets you create lists
and cards, and modify those cards (title and description). On Day 4, you
should also successfully be reading data from and writing it to the
Trello API.

Guess what? There's a ton of functionality in Trello that we still
haven't implemented in Horello. Your work has only just begun!

Spend a few moments getting familiar with how Trello works
(http://www.trello.com). Try adding the following functionality to
Horello. Feel free to attack this list in whatever order you think makes
sense.

1. Delete cards
1. Delete lists
1. Add comments to cards (for now, without users)
1. Card activity feed
1. Card due dates
1. Card labels
1. Card attachments
1. Drag and drop lists to other locations (on the same list, or on a
   different list)
1. Multiple boards
1. Add support for multiple users--think carefully about how users
   should login or otherwise identify themselves, this is up to you!
1. List "members" (now that you have users, you can add all sorts of
   user-related functionality such as list members, user info on list
   comments, card subscribe, etc.)
