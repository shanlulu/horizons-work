# HTML and CSS Challenge: Cloning a website

Great job building the product landing page for Horello. Since you
did such a bangup job, you've been promoted from lowly web developer
to web product manager for our newest product, Horistarter.
Unfortunately, the rest of your team is currently out, recovering
from the Tahiti retreat, and we have an important deadline coming up.
You and your partner are going to have to take one for the team and
build this website on your own.

This time, the team didn't leave think to leave you detailed
instructions or skeleton files. The only resources you have to work
from are the [live Kickstarter webpage][kickstarter] and a set of
[screenshots].

Open up the [skeleton] HTML file to get started. Feel free to create
any other files or directories you need for this project. Try to get
as close as you can to the live site.

You've already learned a lot more about web design than you realize,
and you've got all the fundamentals you need to get started. You'll
be surprised how easy and how much fun this is. See how far you can
get today!

## A few important details

- Don't worry about interactive site elements such as buttons, image
carousels, or popups. We'll discuss elements like these later this
week. But you do have the tools to build almost everything you see on
the live page!
- Don't try to make the page responsive. Just build it for the web
browser on your laptop. We'll discuss this very soon (If you don't know
what this means, don't worry about it, we don't expect you to!)
- You may choose to include the CSS in your HTML file, using the
`<style>` tag, or you may choose to place it in one or more separate
`.css` files. See the [skeleton] HTML file.
- You can save images locally by right-clicking them and choosing
"Save Image As..." in your browser.
- Study the mockup screenshots closely. Use an app like Preview in OS X
so that you can easily pan, zoom, and measure things.
- Chrome's Developer Tools (⌥⌘I, or View > Developer > Developer
Tools) will be even more critical for this project than they were for
the last one, since you don't have specs this time around. Use the
Developer Tools to examine components of the live site.
- The best way to do web development is to make small, incremental
changes to the HTML and CSS and then reload in the browser to see the
changes. When you get comfortable using the power Developer Tools,
you'll see how to test individual changes in real time without
changing your code.
- Don't try to copy the live page in a top-down fashion. Spend some time
examining and thinking about patterns applied throughout the page:
spacing and alignment, typeface, colors, and elements such as buttons
that appear in multiple places. It can be very helpful to have a
library of styles and elements that you can easily install in
multiple places.
- Instead of thinking _linearly_, try to approach the project
_holistically_ (keep the whole page in mind), _abstractly_ (think of
each section or group of elements as a single unit), and
_hierarchically_ (keep in mind how the components relate to one
another, and how properties cascade downwards).
- You may choose to start with a rough layout of the entire page, or
instead to drill down into one component that interests you. There is
no single right approach.

## Site elements

Break the site down into individual elements, and into logical
collections of elements. Pay extra attention to these:

- The warning banner at the top (if you accidentally closed it, open
an Incognito window in your browser and reload the page there to see
it again):

![01-warning]

- The navigation bar in the header. Think about how to space and
align the elements:

![02-navbar]

- The large image at the top--this is called a "hero image" (don't
worry about the image carousel here, just pick a single static image):

![03-hero]

- The category list on the righthand side. Consider how to lay this
out and how to style the text:

![04-list]

- The full project tile:

![05-project]

- Its subcomponents, including the progress bar:

![06-progressbar]

- The columnar list of project tiles:

![07-columns]

- The footer:

![08-footer]

- The list of social media icons at bottom right:

![09-social]
