# Clone your favorite landing page

Is there a landing page (the home page of a website) that you're
in love with? One that you keep going back to every now and then?
Well, you're in luck! For this exercise you will use `HTML` and
`CSS` to make static clones of a landing page of your choosing.

## Pick a landing page

There are over a billion websites currently on the internet, so
choose wisely. Challenge yourself and pick a landing page that
you would be proud to show off once you're done.

_Note:_ you should use the HTML Web Inspector tool to help with
the cloning

**REQUIREMENTS**:
- must have a navbar
- should only be one page

Below are some of our suggestions that meet the criteria and
look pretty cool. Make sure to open these up in incognito
mode (just in case you've logged in to the site).
