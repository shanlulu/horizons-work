## Section 1: HTTP, Express, and Postman

### [Watch me: Express Introduction](https://vimeo.com/212322872)
### [Watch me: HTTP Introduction + Postman](https://vimeo.com/212950789)

### Section 1a. Postman

1. [Install Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and make a `GET` request to
`https://horizons-postman.herokuapp.com/`

    When you are successful you will see a message in the output panel:

    ```
    Great, you're starting the Postman warmup exercise!
    ```

1. Make a `GET` request to `https://horizons-postman.herokuapp.com/1`
    (**note the `/1` at the end**) with the request parameter
    `postman` set to `excellent`.

    You can do this by either editing the URL directly or clicking on `Params` and adding a key and value.

    #### You should see:

    ```
    Success. Part 1 complete
    ```

    </p></details>

1. Now we can make a `PUT` request with some JSON contents. We put the contents of the request in the Body section and change the `Content-Type` header so the server knows how to interpret the data.

    1. Make a request to `https://horizons-postman.herokuapp.com/2`
    1. Set method to `PUT`
    1. Set the body to be `raw` add the content `{ "foods": ["bacon", "lettuce", "tomato"] }`

### Section 1b. Express GET routes

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `/week03/day2/examples/` folder
1. Run `npm install`
1. Open `/week03/day2/examples/server.js` in your favourite text editor.
1. Require the `express` library
1. Initialize your express app instance (`var app = express()`)
1. Create the following routes:
    - __`GET /`__: Send the string `"The Horizons Poet API v1.0"`.
    - __`GET /api/*`__: Send the string `"We couldnâ€™t find any routes matching this endpoint"`.
        - `*` denotes any string (i.e. `/api/anything`, `/api/unicorn`, `/api/p/r/a/t/h`, etc.)
        - you will need to use `app.use()` for this
    - __`GET /api/poem`__: Send the text from the file `/week03/day2/examples/poem.txt`
        - use the following code to read `poem.txt`
            ```js
            var fs = require('fs');
            var poem = fs.readFileSync('./poem.txt', 'utf8');
            ```
    - __`POST /api/success`__: Send the json `{success: true}` using [`res.json()`](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.json)
1. Listen on port __3000__
1. Use Postman to verify all the routes you have created. You can
connect to your local server at `http://localhost:3000`

## Section 2. Queries, Parameters, and Status codes

### [Watch me: HTTP Queries and Parameters](https://vimeo.com/212995568)
### [Watch me: Status Codes](https://vimeo.com/213017476)

1. Open this folder (`week03/day2/examples/express_echo`) in your Terminal on Mac or Git Bash on Windows.
1. Install dependencies with NPM:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
1. Open `app.js` in your editor of choice and add an express http endpoint so that it prints correctly on step 5 (follow the directions in the `app.js` file).
1. Start your server. **Note**: When you change `app.js` you have to restart it to see your changes!
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
1. Verify that your code is working correctly by opening [http://localhost:3000/hello?name=Simba](http://localhost:3000/hello?name=Simba) in Chrome. It should print:

    ```
    Hello there Simba!
    ```
1. Stop your server with <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in your Terminal/PowerShell.

## Section 3. Templating and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

### Section 3a. Setting up Handlebars

### [Watch me: Express Templating](https://vimeo.com/213161919)

The following set of tasks will require setting up your own express app with handlebars templating. You should refer back to the video if you get stuck on a task.

1. Navigate to `/week03/day2/examples/handlebars_examples/hello_world/`: This is the folder you will be working in
1. Start your Node App (you can use `npm init`)
1. Install the required packages
    - `express`
    - `express-handlebars`
1. Create an `app.js` file: This is where you will set up express to use handlebars
1. Create the following routes:
    - `/`: Displays the text `"Hello World"` from a `.hbs` file
    - `/:error`: Displays the text `"<error> page not found, did you enter the correct url?"` where `<error>` is the text entered as a param.
        - __Example:__ `/about` will render a handlebars page with the text `about page not found, did you enter the corrent url?`.
1. Run your node app and make sure the above routes work!

### Section 3b. If-Else in Handlebars

### [Watch me: If-Else Handlebars](https://vimeo.com/213165829)

1. Open `/week03/day2/examples/handlebars_examples/conditional/app.js` and note
how the `/:word` endpoint is implemented.

    This endpoint renders `condition.hbs` with the following data:

    ```js
    {
      isEven: Boolean, // true if word has even number of letters
      word: String // the word entered at :word
    }
    ```

1. Edit `/week03/day2/examples/handlebars_examples/conditional/views/condition.hbs`
and display `<h1>The word <entered-word-here> has an even number of letters!</h1>`
if `isEven` is true, otherwise display
`<h1>The word <entered-word-here> has an odd number of letters!</h1>`

    <details><summary>

### [Watch me: Looping in Handlebars](https://vimeo.com/213169153)

1. Open `/week03/day2/examples/handlesbars_examples/profiles/` in your Terminal
1. Run `npm install`
1. Take a look at `data.json`; this is a list of student info that contians `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `gender`.
1. Create a Handlebars template under `views` that, given an array of students, displays their first name, last name, and email in a list.
1. Create the following routes that render the template you created in the
previous step:
    - `/`: A directory of __ALL__ students
    - `/male`: A directory of __ALL MALE__ students
    - `/female`: A directory of __ALL FEMALE__ students
1. Run `node app.js` to serve your handlebars files on `localhost:3000`
1. Make sure your above routes work as intended!

## Section 4. HTML Forms

### Section 4a. Input Fields & Names

### [Watch Me: Input Fields & Names](https://vimeo.com/213177057)

1. Open `/week03/day2/examples/forms_examples/`: For this example you will write code in the following files
    - `example1.js`
    - `views/example1.hbs`
1. Create a `GET /` route that renders a page with a header and a form.
    - `h1`: A heading tag that's text is based on the input box (in the form).
    - `form`: A form with an `input` box and a submit button
1. Test your route by running `npm install` then `node example1.js` in the terminal. Th
e following steps should work:
    1. Open your favourite web browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`
    1. You should see a heading titled __Default Header__ and a input box with a submit button (like below)

        <details><summary>
        Screenshot
        </summary><p>

        ![form_1_1]

        </p></details>

    1. Type __Change The Header__ into the input box and press submit
    1. The heading should change to __Change The Header__ like below

        <details><summary>
        Screenshot
        </summary><p>

        ![form_1_2]

        </p></details>

[form_1_1]: ../img/form_1_1.png
[form_1_2]: ../img/form_1_2.png

### Section 4b. Form Action Attribute

### [Watch Me: Form Action Attribute](https://vimeo.com/213177626)

In this example you are to make a register form. Make sure that when you press submit, the form data does not change (use the `value` attribute).

1. Open `/week03/day2/examples/forms_examples/`: For this example you will write code in the following files
        - `example2.js`
        - `views/example2.hbs`
1. Create a register form (in `views/example2.hbs`) with the following inputs:
    - username (text input box)
    - password (password input box)
    - name (text input box)
    - gender: male/female/other (radio buttons)
    - __BONUS__ state (dropdown)
1. __BONUS__ Add logic in `example2.js` to make sure the data in your form will __NOT__ be cleared when you press _Register_.
1. `npm install && node example2.js` to test your app.
1. Fill in the form (it should look something like the one below once filled) and click register. Make sure the form stays filled.

    <details><summary>
    Screenshot
    </summary><p>

    ![form_2_1]

    </p></details>

### Section 4c. Form Method Attribute

### [Watch Me: Chrome DevTools Network Tab](https://vimeo.com/213266902)

### [Watch Me: Form Method Attribute](https://vimeo.com/221123663)

Now for this example we're going to implement login functionality for our users. You are to create a __Login Form__ which contains an `email` and `password` field. The list of accounts (along with their passwords) are stored as `JSON` in accounts.js.

1. Open `/week03/day2/examples/forms_examples/`: For this example you will write code in the following files
    - `example3.js`
    - `views/example3.hbs`
1. Create a login form (in `views/example3.hbs`) with the following inputs:
    - email (text input field)
    - password (password input field)
1. Add functionality for your form to `POST` to `/login` on submit
1. In `example3.js` create a `POST` route at `/login` which uses `req.body` to check if the entered email/password fields are in `accounts.json`
    - Given __correct__ credentials render a `h1` tag that says `"Hi [insert-first-name-here]!"` (example below). __NOTE__ that first name can be found in `accounts.json`
    - Given __incorrect__ credentials render a _RED_ error message on your page.

    <details><summary>
    Screenshot
    </summary><p>

    ![form_3_1]

    </p></details>
1. Fill in the form with random credentials and make sure the error message pops up
1. Fill in the form with someone's credentials from `accounts.js` and press Login. You should see the correct heading for that person pop up!
